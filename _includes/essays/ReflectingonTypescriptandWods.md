Reflecting on Typescript and WoDs

As artificial intelligence takes over the world in continuously innovative ways, Typescript, released over a decade ago, continues to be used reliably. Although both are being used to develop software of all types, Typescript has become a staple for a good reason. It is an easy medium to learn and there are many frameworks like React that support its use. Supported by artificial intelligence, the efficiency of Typescript is multiplied and allows for even more capabilities. Typescript is a great programming language that enables software developers to write structured code.

Similar to Python, Typescript is less strict in writing code. There is also an auto-complete feature that helps speed up the process of writing code. AI can be used to speed up the monotonous sections of code that makes Typescript even more efficient in use. Error management and bug-fixing is easier than Java or Python, allowing for fixing code on the spot. No need for waiting for the code to execute to correct code. This allows for good maintenance and clear, structured code.

To help junior developers grow their talents, athletic software engineering is practiced. Workouts of the day or WODs add structure and discipline similar to that of physical training. They are timed coding exercises that require problem solving and efficient use of time. This helps developers grow these corresponding skills. However, not everyone learns efficiently with this method. Although mirroring the professional world as there are oftentimes due dates, learning through this method can add further stress to a new developer. 

Overall, Typescript and artificial intelligence, along with athletic software engineering helps foster development skills. Typescript is a dependable and useful tool for any software developer. Along with AI and athletic software engineering, they will continue to help grow talent for the foreseeable future.
