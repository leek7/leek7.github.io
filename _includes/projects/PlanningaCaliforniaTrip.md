## Introduction

Two months ago I planned the itinerary for a friend's trip to California. Since there were 5 of us, I set up activities, transportation, and housing for 5. We got to travel around Southern California on our 4-day trip. There were amazing memories and adventures created.  

## Experience

We got an Airbnb house in San Diego that allowed us to explore the city thoroughly. It was the best option for 5 people as we could split the cost more efficiently than other options like hotels. We also used a rental car service. I took the burden of setting up the activities and events so we always had something to do. This took the stress off of the others as they could sit back and enjoy the trip.  

## Reflection

From this experience, I gained great life knowledge. Planning a trip like this took a lot of time, and all the problems and hurdles like being late to things added to things. It is understated how stressful going on a trip can be. Throughout it all, I was able to learn efficient time management and thorough planning skills.
