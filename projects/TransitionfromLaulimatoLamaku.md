## Summer 2025 at UH Study Abroad

During the summer of 2025, I worked with the **UH Study Abroad Center** to explore transitioning from **Laulima** to **Lamaku**. Moving all files and data from Laulima proved to be a challenging task. We investigated alternative avenues outside Lamaku to manage the information more efficiently.

## Exploring Alternatives and Tools

I was tasked with exploring different options such as **Google Workspace** for data transition and hosting questionnaires using **SurveyMonkey** for students. We ultimately decided not to transfer everything to Lamaku due to differences in functionality, which were crucial for the department’s workflow. My work contributed to moving our essential processes away from Laulima efficiently.

## Lessons Learned and Teamwork

Through this project, I became familiar with **Lamaku** and discovered that even seemingly simple transitions can be complex. Managing an entire department’s data in Lamaku proved inefficient due to several shortcomings. Working closely with the team strengthened my **teamwork and communication skills**, while providing valuable experience in evaluating digital tools for organizational use.
