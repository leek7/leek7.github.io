## Summer 2024 at UH Manoa Study Abroad

Over the summer of 2024, I worked for the **UH Manoa Study Abroad Center**. I created a Resident Director application form through the **Kuali Build app**, allowing for efficient submissions for faculty applying to oversee Study Abroad programs. This streamlined the application process for **Deans and Department Chairs** across various UH departments. The form is still in use today and has proved useful in organizing applications.

## Building and Maintaining the Form

I developed the document from the ground up using Kuali Build, setting up backend functionality such as **automatic emails** sent to the appropriate recipients when the form is submitted. With input from the Study Abroad staff, the form was **adjusted and edited multiple times** to meet necessary guidelines. The staff currently maintains the form, ensuring it continues to function smoothly.

## Collaboration and Project Management

Through this project, I learned how to **collaborate effectively** to create an important tool for UH administrators. I received instructions on which fields were required and what modifications were needed. This experience also allowed me to practice **project management skills**, such as following a timeline and implementing iterative changes based on feedback.
