Over the summer of 2024, I worked for the UH Manoa Study Abroad Center. I created a Resident Director application form through the **Kuali Build** app that allowed for efficient submissions to apply to the Study Abroad Center as a Resident Director on one of their numerous programs. This allowed Deans and Departments of Chairs of various UH departments to apply to oversee a study abroad program. The use of this form is still ongoing and has proved useful to organize applications.

I created the document from the ground up using Kuali Build. I set up the backend functionality, such as sending emails when the form was submitted to the appropriate people. With the Study Abroad staffâ€™s suggestions, the form was adjusted and edited numerous times to fit the necessary guidelines. The form is currently being maintained by staff.

I learned how to work with others to create an important document to be used by UH Deans and Departments of Chairs. I was given instructions on which fields of the form were needed and what needed to be changed. This allowed me to also learn how to follow a timeline on project management.
